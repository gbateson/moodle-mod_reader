The recommended way to clean your "mod/reader" directory is as follows:

* remove the current "mod/reader", or at least move it out of the "mod" directory
* create a new "mod/reader" directory containing only files from either a standard Reader module zip download, or from the GIT repository

Alternatively, if you give recursive write access to the following "mod/reader" folder, the files may be deleted automatically when you resume the upgrade:

* {$a->dirpath}

The "mod/reader" files that are currently blocking the upgrade are as follows:
{$a->filelist}

If you prefer, you can also delete the above file(s) yourself.
